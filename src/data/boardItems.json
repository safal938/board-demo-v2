Patient reports she tripped over a rug in her living room, falling onto her right side, primarily impacting her wrist. Initial ED documentation, reviewed via chart import, indicated significant right wrist pain. However, patient states now the pain has \"completely resolved\" and she denies any residual discomfort, swelling, or limited ROM in the affected wrist. X-rays performed in the ED were negative for fracture. Pt is relieved about the wrist, but admits still feels a bit unsteady on her feet at times, particularly when tired.\nThe persistent, significant fatigue is the other primary concern. She reports this has been an ongoing issue for several months, possibly worsening over the last 2-3 months. Denies fevers, chills, weight loss, or changes in sleep patterns (though sometimes wakes up tired). States she feels \"just utterly drained, like I've run a marathon, even after doing nothing.\" This impacts her daily function significantly, making routine tasks difficult. RA symptoms (joint pain, swelling) are otherwise generally stable with her current medication regimen, with only mild morning stiffness in hands (approx 30 mins) and occasional intermittent swelling in her 2nd and 3rd MCP joints bilaterally, not severe.
